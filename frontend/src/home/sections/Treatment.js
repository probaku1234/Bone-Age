              <p>
                Several other supplements may enhance human growth hormone
                production, including:
              </p>
              <p>
                Glutamine. A 2-gram dose may temporarily increase levels up to
                78% (66Trusted Source). Creatine. A 20-gram dose of creatine
                significantly increased HGH levels for 2–6 hours (67Trusted
                Source). Ornithine. One study gave participants ornithine 30
                minutes after exercise and found a greater peak in HGH levels
                (68). L-dopa. In patients with Parkinson's disease, 500 mg of
                L-dopa increased HGH levels for up to 2 hours (69Trusted
                Source). Glycine. Studies have found glycine can improve gym
                performance and provide short-term spikes in HGH (70Trusted
                Source).
              </p>
              <p>
                While these supplements may increase your HGH levels, studies
                indicate that their effects are only temporary.

              <h1>Exercising(Stretching)</h1>

              <h2>Can stretching help your child grow taller?</h2>

              <p>
                Yes You don't have to do complex exercises. A simple warming and
                stretching exercise can actually help your children build their
                spine and muscle, which will support them in their growth.
              </p>

              <h2>What kind of stretches make you taller?</h2>

              <p>
                Every pose stretches your back, shoulders,legs and helps you to
                increase your height. Practice side planks, and in a few days,
                you would get excited about the amazing-looking legs you're
                going to have. Side planks give a good stretch to your legs
                making them slimmer and grow taller
              </p>

              <h2>4 Exercises To lengthen Your Child</h2>

              <h3>Stretching</h3>
              <p>
                Stretching is a great way to increase height. Get your child to
                start with simple stretches like the wall stretch. Make him
                stand against a wall with the back towards it. Raise hands in
                the air and stretch as far as possible. Then sit in the same
                position on the toes and stretch the leg muscles. Repeat the
                process 10 times. Another good stretch for the legs and back is
                to sit on the floor, legs wide apart. Then bend forward at the
                waist and stretch to touch the right toe. Your child can keep
                bending three to four times to stretch the leg muscle to the
                maximum. Then go back in the sitting position, and stretch to
                left toe. Toe-touching exercises are also great to elongate the
                spine and improving posture.
              </p>

              <h3>Yoga</h3>
              <p>
                Some yoga asanas, especially the Surya Namaskar and the Adho
                Mukha Syanasana stretches the whole body easily. Have your child
                do basic breathing exercises before beginning. Then lie down on
                the back, lift hips and stretch legs backwards. Make sure the
                back is absolutely straight. Maintain this position and continue
                deep breathing for as long as possible. Also, poses like the
                Chakrasana can also help your child stretch the entire body.
                Here, make your child lie down flat on the back, legs
                shoulder-width apart. Bend knees so they touch the buttocks and
                bend elbows so that fingers touch the shoulder. Breath in and
                push up the body to create a ‘U’ position and hold for as long
                as possible. Release the position, breathing out and rest for a
                few seconds before repeating the pose.
              </p>

              <h3>Hanging</h3>
              <p>
                All kids love to hang from bars and this playful exercise can
                help straighten the spine and elongate the vertebrates. So
                encourage your child to do plenty of pull-ups. Install a hanging
                bar in the house. Preferably, the bar should allow your child to
                be able to hang fully above the ground. But if you are more
                concerned about safety, you can also teach your child to hang
                with the legs bent at the knees. It is best to hang for one to
                10 minutes every day. Make your child do 10 repetitions of
                pull-ups or chin-ups daily for best results.
              </p>

              <h3>High-Intensity Workouts</h3>
              <p>
                It is not recommended for children under the age of 16 to lift
                weights or do any kind of stressful weight training. During this
                period, muscles need to develop naturally, and only
                high-intensity workouts and sports are best. Lifting weights at
                a gym can actually hamper the height of your child, so don’t
                allow it. However, sports like basketball, tennis and badminton
                are all great ways to promote growth hormones in the body and
                help your child grow taller. Running, swimming and cycling are
                also great options.
              </p>

              <h2>5 Tips to Help Children Grow Taller:</h2>

              <h3>Healthy Eating Habits</h3>
              <p>
                Having a healthy eating habit is an important factor in the
                growth of our children. Their body needs proper nutrition in
                order to optimize their growth. Protein is important in
                optimizing the height of children and can be found in many
                natural sources such as eggs and soya beans. In addition, you
                also need to ensure that your children receive adequate intake
                of vitamins and minerals from natural sources such as spinach,
                carrots, mangoes, and others.
              </p>

              <h3>Regular Exercise</h3>
              <p>
                Other than to prevent obesity, exercise is very important for
                your children as it will help the growth of their muscle. There
                are many kinds of sports that you and your children can do to
                help them advance in height, such as swimming, yoga, and other
                kind of fun activities. You don’t have to do complex exercises.
                A simple warming and stretching exercise can actually help your
                children build their spine and muscle, which will support them
                in their growth.
              </p>

              <h3>Adequate Sleep</h3>
              <p>
                Children’s bodies produce various hormones during sleeping time
                that will support their growth. Thus, it is necessary for them
                to have adequate sleep each night. Toddlers require 11-13 hours
                of sleep each day while school-age children require 10-11 hours
                each day.
              </p>

              <h3>Good Posture</h3>
              <p>
                Encourage your children to be continuously aware of their
                postures, like no slouching while standing or sitting down. Good
                posture will make your children taller and more upright, which
                will also boost their self-confidence.
              </p>

              <h3>Drink Milk Regularly</h3>
              <p>
                Calcium plays an important role in the development of bone
                structure of your children. Milk is a rich source of calcium.
                So, make it a habit for your children to drink milk every day in
                order to meet their daily calcium requirements, and for
                optimizing the growth of their bones.

              <h1>Growth Hormone Treatment</h1>

              <h2>What is Growth Hormone Treatment?</h2>

              <p>
                Growth hormone injection treatment is prescribed for children
                who have been diagnosed with growth hormone (GH) deficiency and
                other conditions causing short stature.
              </p>
              <p>
                A number of other tests must be conducted first to confirm GH
                deficiency, Turner Syndrome, or other conditions for which GH
                therapy is indicated. These tests may include stimulation tests,
                MRIs, and x-rays. GH treatment has few side effects.
              </p>

              <p>
                GH treatment is a safe, effective way to treat growth hormone
                deficiency, Turner Syndrome, and a few other conditions
                associated with short stature.

              </p>

              <h2>What age should a child start growth hormone therapy?</h2>

              <p>
                GH injections are quick and almost pain-free, so children ages
                10 and up may be able to and often prefer to give themselves
                their own injections. It is important that a parent supervises
                the injection to make sure the child gives the correct dosage
                each day. Parents should give the injections to younger children
              </p>
